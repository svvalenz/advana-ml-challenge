# Advana ML Challenge - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Advana ML Challenge, which involves operationalizing a machine learning model for flight delay prediction at SCL airport.

## Implementation Summary

### Part I: Model Implementation

**Objective:** Transcribe the Jupyter notebook into a production-ready `model.py` file.

**Implementation:**
- **Model Choice:** Logistic Regression with class balancing
- **Reasoning:** After analyzing the notebook, Logistic Regression showed the best balance between performance and interpretability. The model achieved good recall for the minority class (delays) while maintaining reasonable precision.
- **Key Features:** Top 10 most important features identified in the notebook:
  - OPERA (airlines): Latin American Wings, Grupo LATAM, Sky Airline, Copa Air
  - MES (months): 4, 7, 10, 11, 12
  - TIPOVUELO: International vs National flights

**Feature Engineering:**
- `period_day`: Categorizes flight time into morning, afternoon, and night
- `high_season`: Identifies peak travel periods (Dec-Mar, Jul, Sep)
- `min_diff`: Calculates delay in minutes between scheduled and actual departure
- `delay`: Binary target (1 if delay > 15 minutes, 0 otherwise)

**Code Quality:**
- Type hints for all methods
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling and validation
- Clean separation of concerns with private helper methods

**Test Results:** 4/4 tests passing with 99% code coverage

### Part II: API Implementation

**Objective:** Deploy the model using FastAPI.

**Implementation:**
- **Framework:** FastAPI (as required)
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /`: Welcome endpoint with API information
  - `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
  - `POST /predict`: Flight delay prediction endpoint

**Features:**
- **Input Validation:** Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Error Handling:** Proper HTTP status codes (400 for validation errors)
- **Batch Processing:** Support for multiple flight predictions in single request
- **Model Integration:** Automatic model training on startup
- **Documentation:** Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation

**Validation Rules:**
- Airlines must be from the original dataset
- TIPOVUELO must be 'I' (International) or 'N' (National)
- MES must be between 1 and 12

**Test Results:** 4/4 tests passing with 87% code coverage

### Part III: Cloud Deployment

**Objective:** Deploy the API to Google Cloud Platform.

**Implementation:**
- **Platform:** Google Cloud Run
- **Container:** Docker with Python 3.10-slim base image
- **Configuration:**
  - Memory: 2GB
  - CPU: 2 cores
  - Timeout: 300 seconds
  - Port: 8080
- **Security:** Non-root user, health checks, proper environment variables

**Deployment URL:** https://advana-ml-api-835573758019.us-central1.run.app

**Features:**
- Automatic scaling
- HTTPS enabled
- Public access
- Health monitoring

**Test Results:** API successfully deployed and responding to all endpoints

### Part IV: CI/CD Implementation

**Objective:** Implement proper CI/CD workflows.

**Implementation:**

**CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**
- Triggers on push to main/develop and pull requests
- Python 3.10 setup with dependency caching
- Runs model tests (`make model-test`)
- Runs API tests (`make api-test`)
- Generates coverage reports
- Uploads test artifacts

**CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`):**
- Triggers on push to main branch
- Google Cloud SDK setup
- Docker image build and push to GCR
- Automatic deployment to Cloud Run
- Health checks post-deployment
- Deployment status notifications

**Features:**
- Automated testing on every commit
- Automated deployment on main branch
- Coverage reporting
- Artifact storage
- Health verification

## Technical Decisions

### Model Selection
- **Chosen:** Logistic Regression with class balancing
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Good performance on imbalanced dataset
  - Interpretable results
  - Fast inference time
  - Proven effective in the notebook analysis

### API Design
- **Framework:** FastAPI chosen for its performance and automatic documentation
- **Validation:** Pydantic for robust input validation
- **Error Handling:** Consistent HTTP status codes and error messages

### Deployment Strategy
- **Platform:** Google Cloud Run for serverless deployment
- **Container:** Docker for consistent environments
- **Scaling:** Automatic scaling based on demand

### CI/CD Strategy
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting
- **Deployment:** Automated deployment with health checks
- **Monitoring:** Artifact storage and deployment notifications

## Performance Metrics

- **Model Coverage:** 99%
- **API Coverage:** 87%
- **Total Coverage:** 94%
- **Test Success Rate:** 100% (8/8 tests passing)
- **API Response Time:** < 1 second for predictions
- **Deployment Time:** ~2 minutes

## Security Considerations

- Non-root user in Docker container
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- HTTPS enabled in production
- Environment variable configuration

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Enhancements:**
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Model versioning
   - A/B testing framework

2. **API Enhancements:**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Request logging and monitoring

3. **Infrastructure:**
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Database integration for model storage
   - Monitoring and alerting

4. **CI/CD:**
   - Integration with model registry
   - Automated model retraining
   - Blue-green deployments

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully operationalizes the data science work into a production-ready system. All requirements have been met with high code quality, comprehensive testing, and proper deployment practices. The system is ready for production use and can handle real-world flight delay prediction requests.
